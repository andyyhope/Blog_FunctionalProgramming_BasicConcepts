# Swift Functional Programming: Basic Concepts
## Kinda like reverse Fight Club for developers

Usually people that learn functional programming (also known as FP) don’t shut up about it, to a point where it would almost be irritable if it just wasn’t so darn cool. Imagine the famous scene of the 1999 classic cult movie Fight Club, but completely flipped on it’s head.

> **Rules of Functional Programming Club:**
> 
> 1. You do not shut up about Functional Programming.
> 2. You do NOT shut up about Functional Programming!

Some people also liken functional programmers to Crossfit enthusiasts, but unlike Crossfit, functional programming doesn’t have a 73.5% chance of you sustaining an injury preventing you from working. It actually improves the safety, readability and general awesomeness of the code you write.

Swift is by no-means a purely functional programming language such as Haskell, but instead it’s more of a beautiful Frankenstein/multi-paradigm language by taking bits and pieces of other languages and making them cohesive with one another.

In this first part, we’re going to look at the more simpler concepts of functional programming and demonstrate how the Swift language enables us to write functional code.
